"""bm-c S6 chain runner (reusable).

Runs the 43 S6 data/panel maintenance legs in the order fixed by the round
prompt, records {leg, rc, elapsed} for each into
results/_r<round>bmc_s6_chain.json and prints a compact tail summary.

Usage: python Tools\\s6_chain_bmc.py <round_no>
Exit 0 always (legs are recorded; non-zero legs are reported, not fatal) --
the round report must surface any rc!=0 leg verbatim.

Why a shared runner: the per-round chain used to be an ad-hoc script rebuilt
every window (r1179..r1182 clones) which cost most of the round's wall time in
generation rather than measurement.
